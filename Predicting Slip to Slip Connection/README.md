# Slip to Slip Connection Prediction
This is project that was part of a Data Science interview challenge. The company that posted this challenge is a consulting company offering an opening to be working as a data scientist on the O&G (Oil and Gas) field. 

The challenge is to analyse a time-series dataset to predict during oil and gas production on a drilling operation whether a slip is connected or not when it's being used to grip and hold the upper part of a drill pipe to the drill floor. The main goal of this project is to identify and predict how long the drilling team is taking to make a new connection to the extraction pipe. This is part of a **KPI** to measure and monitor the operational quality and crew performance.

**Project Status: Complete**

## Project Introduction

The goal of this project is to create a supervised machine learning model (binary classifier) on a time-series data to predict if the slip device is connected to the drilling pipe in a given time.

### Methods Used
- Exploratory data analysis (EAD)
- Feature engineering and feature creation
- Data visualization
- Outliers analysis
- Time-series cross-validation
- Predictive modeling using XGBoost
- Assessing the model's performance

### Technologies
- Python (Main programming language)
- Jupyter (IDE)
- Numpy (Math and linear algebra)
- Pandas (Reading/Editing tabular data)
- Matplotlib and Seaborn (Data visualization)
- Sklearn (Most used ML library with ML pipeline features)
- XGBoost (ML model)
