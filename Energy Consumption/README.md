# Energy Consumption:electric_plug:
Time series forecasting with Python using the XGBoost Regressor to predict hourly energy consumption.

**Project Status: Complete**

## Project Introduction

The purpose of this project is to create a supervised machine learning model on a time series data to predict the energy consumed by PJM Interconnection.

### Methods Used
- Exploratory data analysis (EAD)
- Feature engineering and feature creation
- Data visualization
- Predictive modeling using XGBoost
- Assessing the model's performance 
- Uderstanding the predicted values and assessing improvements to be made

### Technologies
- Python (Main programming language)
- Jupyter (IDE)
- Numpy (Math and linear algebra)
- Pandas (Reading/Editing tabular data)
- Matplotlib and Seaborn (Data visualization)
- Sklearn (Most used ML library with ML pipeline features)
- XGBoost (ML model)

## Project Description
The <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robikscube/hourly-energy-consumption">data</a> used is from an US energy transmission company the PJM Interconnection. It stands for the hourly energy consumed/transmited which is supplied by the American Electric Power company. The data is comprised of only 2 columns the datetime of the measured energy consumed and the total energy consumed AEP_MW in Megawatts (MW). The historic data is from Sep-2004 to Aug-2018.

## Outlines of Version 2
- Outliers analysis
- Added new features
- Time series cross-validation
- Exhaustive hyperparameters tuning
- Added section for production predictions

## Needs of this project
- Try other ML models
